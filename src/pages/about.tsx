                Born and raised in Mountain View, CA (Before google took over the town), I went to
                html summer camps at Stanford as a kid and I have always been messing around on
                computers. I attended college in San Francisco, and after college I moved to NYC to
                be closer to family. I started working with an architectural design firm and
                absorbed more and more of their IT and accounting workload, enabling the firm to let
                go of IT contracts and consolidate their backend needs.

                In 2015, I was getting tired of consuming so many faulty websites and apps and kept
                seeing the limitations of the app or places where I wanted to tweak the app. Some
                times a small part of the design or other times want to add more robust features or
                want to even totally redo the app entirely. I wanted to really start creating and
                contributing, so I started to take MOOC's and follow various tutorials working
                mainly with Python and Ruby, building various projects, a sandwich tracker and some
                other small projects, but the magic was hidden behind gems and I wanted to really
                get into the nitty gritty, end of 2016 decided to take a bigger step, kick this
                thing into gear for real. I went through a full stack javascript boot camp program
                where I was paired with a senior developer(10+years experience) as a mentor to work
                on the MERN stack.

                I have focused mainly on React and Node while working for companies of all sizes.
                Startups getting traction (product changing by the minute) to enterprise (Largest
                Healthcare company in US). Like anything there is tradeoffs, I enjoy the smaller
                company experience where the team is more nimble and can adopt new technologies, and
                also enjoy the enterprise work where we have a million active monthly users and
                managing volume efficiently is paramount.

                My coding style is writing predictable maintainable code with high % of test
                coverage. I leverage descriptive naming and uniform syntax/consistency across files
                and folder organization. If there is a lack of order when I land in a new code base,
                you will find me chipping away/refactoring for uniform structure in my downtime. I
                have refactored code bases where props are renamed multiple times during prop
                drilling, where nested ternaries had become the norm and css specificity had run
                amuck with 10,000+ loc css files. Working in large code bases, I feel strongly about
                not compromising on uniform syntax, uniform structure and descriptive naming. The
                goal is to be able to jump in get oriented add a feature/make the change, add tests
                and ship ship ship.

                When I'm not javascripting away or expanding my knowledge of Rust and Golang, you
                can find me rescuing animals with Unwanted NYC Pets, and cycling or running around
                NYC. To be honest I don't particularly enjoy writing own bios much. If you got this
                far I'll take you out for Banh Mi or a beer or who knows, heck I'll even help you
                move apartments if you need it. Hit me up !
