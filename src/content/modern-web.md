##The right tool for the right job

Thinking this morning about all the options/paths to building for the web, and the differing opinions/preferences/discussions always taking place online about why to use Y over X. And went looking for and revisited a great post written last year on SPA fatigue - <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Spa Fatigue">"Second-guessing the modern web"</a> by
<a href="https://macwright.com/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Tom MacWright"> Tom MacWright </a>

Surfacing this again as a reminder for myself and reflecting on this post and keeping this front and center as I think of the web with my React colored glasses. Of course developer experience is an important consideration 100%, but then when we get into the weeds of performance optimizations and beyond not instantiating a new object on every render of React and wrapping every component in memo/ using PureComponents, we can look outside our literal "framework" and leverage that clutch html and cdns and score those wins for speed and UX.

Keep it simple future reader! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it!" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="You aren't gonna need it"> YAGNI !</a>
