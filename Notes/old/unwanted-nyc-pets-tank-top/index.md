[![Unwanted NYC Pets Tank Top](http://nickfoden.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/kristin-in-tank-top.jpg)](http://www.etsy.com/listing/95298279/i-heart-my-rescued-pet-tank-top-designed)

Support Unwanted NYC Pets with a tank top for summer! 100% of proceeds go to rescuing dogs from Brooklyn and Manhattans city shelters. Dogs in there only have 3-5 days to be adopted before being put down. Help us get them out and give them more time to find forever homes!
