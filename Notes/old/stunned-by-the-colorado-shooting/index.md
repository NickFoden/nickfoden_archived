I was stunned early this morning reading about this tragedy before falling back asleep. And I am still stunned. How did the shooter get [into the theater with 2 "Long Guns" and a handgun](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/colorado-shooting-james-holmes_n_1688996.html)? I mean past the how, why shoot up a theater? What was the thought process? What is ever the thought process with these shooters?

Is it like the suicide mentality described In David Foster Wallace's - Infinite Jest ? “the person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise” (Wallace 696)

What built up in the shooters life that this was the right course of action? How is this where he went with his life? How common is this across our country? Everyone bottled up in their own minds? No one talking anything out? No one checking on the other? Just living in pain alone until the pain is too much?

This girl Jessica Redfield narrowly avoided the Toronto shooting by three minutes a month ago and then was killed this morning in the Colorado Shooting.

Her final tweets before the shooting this morning. [https://twitter.com/jessicaredfield](https://twitter.com/jessicaredfield)

After reading and skimming her blog and twitter, she was just a normal, happy, motivated person who was living life before this pointless violence brought it all to a halt.

Stunned.
