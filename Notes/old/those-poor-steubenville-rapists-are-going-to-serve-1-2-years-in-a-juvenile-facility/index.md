The CNN coverage was so atrocious. It was surreal to watch. How did anyone working on that video think that was OK to go to air in any capacity.

In a thought provoking  post, [Henry Rollins takes a turn at discussing](http://henryrollins.com/dispatch/detail/dispatch_03-17-12_los_angeles/) the bigger issue while acknowledging  "that the person who is going to do a life sentence is her."

Also after watching "[The House I Live In](http://www.thehouseilivein.org/)" makes me think how it's really incredible that up until 2010 in the US someone caught with 5 grams of crack would server a mandatory minimum of 5 years yet someone raping an unconscious girl with his friend while taking video and spewing vile horrible remarks, is getting 1 year and an outcry of sympathy from a major news outlet.

"For readers interested in learning more about how not to be labeled as registered sex offenders, a good first step is not to rape unconscious women, no matter how good your grades are." via [Gawker](http://gawker.com/5991003/cnn-reports-on-the-promising-future-of-the-steubenville-rapists-who-are-very-good-students)
