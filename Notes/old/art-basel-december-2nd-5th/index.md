Looking at flights, and I am thinking that it will be just about the perfect time to dip out of NYC. December 2nd to 5th. Every year the pictures that go up from friends are just chock full of tons of fun. I think it might be impossible to not have a blast and a half in Miami though.

I spent the same amount in Miami in 3 days that I did in Vegas in 3 days. And in Miami i wasn't blowing money on blackjack like it was the end of the world.
