As my friend [Courtney](http://twitter.com/#!/CBM) linked this morning [Business Cards](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/04/AR2010100406824.html) are not going anywhere.

I kind of thought the cellphone bar codes might catch on as business cards, but they haven't and so it's time to dream up some witty tag lines for my business cards.Â  I am thinking of making 3 different ones. Maybe a few more too, but so far I tentatively have:

1. Overly Professional - (still not sure what to say)
2. Somewhat funny - "Getting it done since fall of '84"
3. Extremely Crude - "Clutch as Fuck"
