#### People in this town drink too much coffee.

#### They're jumpy all the time.

#### You see them drinking out of their big plastic mugs while they're driving.

#### They cut in front of you, they steal your parking places.

#### Teenagers in the cemeteries knocking over tombstones are slurping caf√© au lait.

#### Recycling men hanging onto their trucks are sipping espresso.

#### Dogcatchers running down the street with their nets are savoring their cups of mocha java.

#### The holdup man entering a convenience store first pours himself a nice warm cup of coffee.

#### Down the funeral parlor driveway a boy on a skateboard is spilling his.

#### They're so serious about their coffee, it's all they can think about, nothing else matters.

#### Everyone's wide awake but looks incredibly tired.
