“Community emerges when we are willing to share real concerns of our lives. But in our society, you are reluctant to bring your concerns to me because you fear I am going to try to ‘fix’ you- and I am reluctant to receive your concerns because I fear am going to have to ‘fix’ you. We have no middle ground between invading one another and ignoring one another.”
